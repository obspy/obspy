# How to build (Ana)Conda packages

Install the necessary tools with

```bash
$ conda install binstar conda-build
```

You also need to login to binstar once thus you need an account and you have to be part of the ObsPy organization on binstar.

```bash
$ binstar login
```

Once in a while its also a good idea to clean the `conda-bld` directory in the root conda path. `$ conda info` shows the location of that paths. Lots of things are cached there and if the version number of the conda package does not change it will reuse previously downloaded files.


## For Linux Using Docker

This must be done on a Linux with a fairly old `libc` version. We currently do it for `libc 2.12`, thus it is done in Docker containers.

Make sure Docker is installed and running (also that some space is left on your disc or boot2docker's VM!). Execute

```bash
$ ./build_conda_packages_linux.sh
```

This will take a while but it will build packages for all Python versions on 64 and 32 bit. It will copy the final packages to `conda_builds` so as a last step you have to upload them from your local machine.

```bash
$ cd conda_builds
$ binstar upload -u obspy linux-32/obspy*
$ binstar upload -u obspy linux-64/obspy*
```

## For OSX

On OSX just execute (from this directory)

```bash
$ conda build --py all obspy
```

Afterwards check (on of the last lines in the output) where the packages are stored and

```bash
$ cd /path/to/packages
$ binstar upload -u obspy --channel docker --channel main obspy*
```

## For Windows

Currently performed on AppVeyor using this: https://github.com/obspy/conda-builder
