                   libmseed - The Mini-SEED library

The Mini-SEED library provides a framework for manipulation of SEED
data records including the unpacking and packing of data records.
Functionality is also included for managing waveform data as
continuous traces.  All structures of SEED 2.4 data records are
supported with the following exceptions: Blockette 2000 opaque data
which has an unknown data structure by definition and Blockette 405
which depends on full SEED (SEED including full ASCII headers) for a
full data description.

The library has been tested in Linux, Mac OSX (Darwin), Solaris and
Win32 environments.

For installation instructions see the INSTALL file.  For further
information regarding the library interface see the documentation in
the 'doc' directory.  For example uses of libmseed see the source code
in the 'examples' directory.
