## Automatically

The easiest way to install ObsPy under Mac is to use the fully self contained OSX Application of ObsPy and all its dependencies. No need to install anything else, just this one application.

Another very convenient method to install ObsPy on various Mac OS X versions and along with various other python packages is though the MacPorts Projects package management system (http://www.macports.org). This is especially true for users already using MacPorts. Not-yet-users MacPorts are encouraged to give it a try! The method via MacPorts would install all dependencies and ObsPy either from a pre-compiled binary package or from source. Here the details:

## Manually

If you cannot use the self contained installer, you can build ObsPy and the dependencies from source:
