# Unfortunately setuptools and numpy.distutils do not like each other and lot's
# of small incompatibilities are around. One manifestation of this is that the
# source code and data files included in the setup.py are included in binary
# distributions but not in source distributions...
# Therefore the MANIFEST.in files appears to be necessary.
