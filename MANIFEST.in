# Unfortunately setuptools and numpy.distutils do not like each other and lot's
# of small incompatibilities are around. One manifestation of this is that the
# source code and data files included in the setup.py are included in binary
# distributions but not in source distributions...
# Therefore the MANIFEST.in files appears to be necessary.

# Include all files in top-level and obspy-top-level directories (e.g. CHANGELOG, RELEASE-VERSION, ...)
include *  # seem to catch only files, so ./misc and ./debian are not catched.. good!
recursive-include obspy *  # includes all files in any subdirs, so it also catches *all* subdirs

# exclude rules
global-exclude *.pyc
exclude .* appveyor.yml
prune obspy/*/docs  # manual pdfs amount to approx. 10MB, leave them out
# Exclude the misc directory (not necessary it seems, seems directories in top-level gett left out on default)
#prune misc
