## Automatically

The easiest way to install ObsPy under Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8) is using the ObsPy Installer.

* Download: [ObsPy Installer for Python 2.7.2 (32-bit and 64-bit)](https://github.com/obspy/obspy/raw/master/misc/installer/win-py2.7/obspy-setup.exe)<br /><br />

The setup program will automatically download and install all necessary components needed for using ObsPy, e.g. handle the installation of Python, all required dependencies and all ObsPy modules. Already installed components will be skipped.

It is safe to re-run the installer to upgrade an existing installation.
