0.9.1:
 - obspy.core:
   * fixing very slow response removal for some magic bad values of npts
     (see #715)
   * extend remove_response for polynomial responses  
     (thanks to Sebastien/bonaime, see #566)

   * bugfix: channel code now correctly read (4 hex char)
   * bugfix: channels can have different sampling rate
   * improvement: datawide 0.5 (4 bits) encoding now supported
 - obspy.fdsn:
   * time out errors get raised properly now. timeout can be specified at
     Client initialization now. (see #717)
 - obspy.station:
   * some bugfixes in the obspy.station object classes (see #710)
 - obspy.taup:
   * bugfix: avoid a bug that caused multiple calls to taup to result in

0.9.0:
 -  general:
   * Added mock testing library.
 - obspy.arclink:
   * user keyword is now required during client initialization
 - obspy.core:
   * Stream/Trace.attach_response(): convenience method to attach response to
     traces from inventories.
   * new method Stream/Trace.remove_response() to remove instrument response
     from Response object attached to trace(s), e.g. after parsing a
     StationXML file. Similar to Stream/Trace.simulate(seedresp=...) for
     using a Parser object (from dataless or xseed) or RESP file, but less
     cluttered parameters and without the simulating a different instrument
     part.
   * Updated event classes to QuakeML 1.2 final.
   * Moved obspy.core.event.validate() to obspy.core.quakeml.validate()
   * The writeQuakeML() function, also accessible through
     Catalog.write(..., format="quakeml"), now has an optional keyword
     argument 'validate'. If True, the resulting QuakeML file will be
     validated against the QuakeML schema before being written. An
     AssertionError will be raised in case the validation fails.
   * validation of QuakeML against official schema working now
   * renamed obspy.core.util.types into obspy.core.util.obspy_types (#595)
   * new parameter replace for Enums which allows definition of replaceable
     keywords (fixes #531)
   * Trace.split() will return a stream object containing traces with unmasked
     arrays

     tapering for all windowing functions and perform one-sided tapering
   * Many Stream and Trace methods are now chainable, e.g. st.taper().plot()
   * when using Stream/Trace.simulate(seedresp={...})) parameter "date" can
     now be omitted, start time of each trace is used for response lookup then
   * when using Stream/Trace.simulate(seedresp={...})) for parameter
     "filename" instead of the path to a local file now also can be provided
     either a file-like object with RESP information or an obspy.xseed.Parser
     object (e.g. created reading a dataless SEED file).
   * fix Stream.select() when using values like "" or 0, e.g.
     Stream.select(location="") or when filtering by component with a channel
     code less than 3 characters long (now these traces will be omitted from
     the result when filtering by component).
   * fix a bug when merging valid data into a masked trace (see #638)
   * event.ResourceIdentifier objects are now initialized with a QuakeML
     conform string by default, i.e. if no custom prefix is provided during
     initialization.
   * event.ResourceIdentifier.resource_id attribute was renamed to
     event.ResourceIdentifier.id
   * event.ResourceIdentifier now was has a method regenerate_uuid() that
     allows the random hash part to be regenerated for resource identifiers
     with no fixed id string (can be useful to generate a new hash if the
     referred object changes).
   * added a new test that asserts that the whole codebase is valid according
     to the flake8 tool.
   * inverse filtering of catalogs.
   * bugfix: Trace.simulate() now passes the SEED network, station, location,
     and channel identifiers to evalresp.

     waveform files
   * check if ndim == 1 when setting Trace.data and raise if necessary,

     WaveformStreamID as specified in QuakeML docs (#633)
 - obspy.css:
   * new module for CSS (Center for Seismic Studies) format
   * currently read support for waveform data
 - obspy.db:
   * obspy-indexer script uses from now on hash symbols (#) instead
     of pipe (|) for features because pipe has a special meaning on
     most operating systems
 - obspy.fdsn:
   * new client module to access servers based on the FDSN web service
     definition (http://www.fdsn.org/webservices/)

   * added plotting of record sections
   * automatic merging can be disabled for obspy-plot

     object. Only the "mchedr" format (file format revision of February 24,
     2004) is supported.
 - obspy.realtime:
   * two new processing plugins (offset, kurtosis)
 - obspy.seg2:
   * adding read support for SEG2 data format code 1 and 2
     (signed 16bit/32bit integer)

   * fix a bug in plotting (see #689)
 - obspy.signal:
   * adding cross correlation single-station similarity checking with
     master event templates to coincidence trigger
   * add PPSD support for segments of arbitrary length
   * default bin width of PPSD is changed to 1dB. This is the value used by
     McNamara and Buland 2004.
   * fix a bug when using evalresp with RESP files with very short epochs.
     see #631.
   * for seisSim(seedresp={...})) for parameter "filename" instead of the
     path to a local file now also can be provided either a file-like
     object with RESP information or an obspy.xseed.Parser object
     (e.g. created reading a dataless SEED file).
   * seisSim(seedresp={...}): the seedresp dictionary now requires network,
     station, location, and channel keys.
   * removed deprecated psd module - use spectral_estimation module instead
   * removed deprecated sonic function - use array_processing function instead
   * corrected function signature of c_sac_taper
