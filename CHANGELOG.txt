     * numpy < 1.6
     * scipy < 0.10
 - obspy.ah
   * New submodule for reading the AH (Ad Hoc) waveform format

     performs a cumtrapz integration. The first value of an integrated trace
     will now always be zero to avoid changes in the total length of the
     time series. Furthermore no more options are allowed as they might mess
     with the time of a trace.

     either a file-like object with RESP information or an obspy.xseed.Parser
     object (e.g. created reading a dataless SEED file).
   * fix Stream.select() when using values like "" or 0, e.g.
