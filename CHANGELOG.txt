1.3.0 (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.6327346)
===================================

Changes:
 - obspy.*
   * no more support for Python 2 (see #2577)
   * added python 3.9 and 3.10 tests for all platforms,
     minimal supported python version is 3.7 (#2925, #2489)
   * removed os.path calls with pathlib library calls (see #2751).
   * rewrote CI tests to make use of cache (see #2936)
   * removed individual logging configurations in Obspy, logging can be
     configured by the user, see documentation of Pythons logging module,
     only the FDSN mass downloader automatically configures logging as before,
     but this behavior can be turned off now. The loglevel keywords are
     therefore deprecated and have no effect anymore (see #2720)
   * refactored obspy-runtest to use pytest and modified several command
     line arguments, required to disable image comparisons (see #2489)
   * removed calls to deprecated NumPy functionality (see #2949, #2981)
   * cleaned the documentation, build process, and docstrings (see #2662, #2954)
   * refactored and modernized setup.py (see #2422)
 - scripts:
   * SDS report: try to be faster on slow filesystems (see #3009)
 - obspy.core:
   * speed up import of obspy core functions (see #2758)
   * read_inventory(): add "level" option to read files faster when less level
     of detail is needed. currently only implemented for StationXML reading
     (see #2759)
   * add option to suppress evalresp sensitivity mismatch warning when removing
     instrument response (see #2677)
   * round magnitudes in Catalog/Event string representation to one decimal
     (see #2742)
   * add support for pathlib.Path objects in read(), read_inventory() and
     read_events() functions (see #2743)
   * add a "DEF" option (default units) to Inventory.plot_response() and
     Trace.remove_response() (see #2806)
   * stream.select(): circumvent wildcard-matching when called with a trace-id
     without wildcards for quicker trace selection.
   * Inventory addition now consistently uses shallow copies (#2675, #2694)
   * removed obsolete wrapper around numpy.loadtxt causing import error with
     numpy 1.22 (see #2912, #2913)
   * fix iso8601 regex for issue #2868 to cope with day 360 properly
   * fix crash when resampling very short traces (see #2926)
   * response list stages: do not raise an exception if response calculation
     involves extrapolation outside of frequency range defined by the response
     list stage but rather only show a warning. raising an exception is the
     safe route but it also prevents valid calculations as it is up to the user
     to make sure that signal spectrum is properly suppressed in those
     frequency ranges outside of the valid response information (see #2988)
   * fix a bug while checking for valid URI syntax when setting identifiers on
     inventory type objects (see #2905)
 - obspy.clients.arclink:
   * submodule removed completely, since ArcLink was officially deprecated and
     deactivated on all big datacenters years ago (see #2994)
 - obspy.clients.fdsn:
   * introduce fine-grained FDSN client exceptions (see #2653, #2964)
   * support for "eventtype" parameter in get_events(), as specified in version
     1.2 of the FDSN event web service (see #2780)
   * Hostnames with hyphens and long TLDs are no longer rejected as invalid
     FDSN server URLs (#2878)
   * add URL mapping for IRISPH5, IESDMC, GEOFON (alternative to GFZ)
     (see #2739, #2932)
   * update RESIF URL mapping to use http and add RESIFPH5 (see #2938)
 - obspy.clients.filesystem:
   * add get_waveforms_bulk() method to SDS client (see #2616, #2626)
   * SDS client get_latency(): make one internal check optional which can be a
     massive speedup on slow filesystems (see #3009)
 - obspy.clients.seedlink:
   * basic client: properly terminate after finished get_info() request (see
     #2996)

   * fix section plot in case of a single trace only (see #2764)
   * removed basemap, now only cartopy is supported for maps (see #2961)
   * fix day plot when passed a small interval (see #2967)
 - obspy.clients.filesystem.tsindex:
   * improvements to leap second file setup and other small fixes (see #2776)

 - obspy.io
   * add support to resolve the SEED id of picks for nlloc hyp files and
     nordic files, refactor the same functionality for SeismicHandler evt
     and HypoDD pha files. Some parameter names therefore changed in the
     latter, but former parameter names are still supported (see #2251)
 - obspy.io.css:
   * open CSS waveforms even if gzip-compressed (see #2736)
 - obspy.io.gse2:
   * When reading GSE2 bulletins, station magnitudes now include waveform IDs
     and have associated station magnitude contributions (see #2718)
 - obspy.io.hypodd
   * add PHA write support (see #2687)
   * add read support for horizontal and vertical origin uncertainty (see #2687)
 - obspy.io.kinemetrics:
   * adds the ``apply_calib`` argument to the ``read_evt`` method to allow
     obtaining the raw data bits stored in the evt file (see #2582), note this
     changes the default (wrong!) behaviour, by default the data returned will
     be the NOT corrected ones. When passing ``apply_calib=True``, the
     calibration factor will be used.
 - obspy.io.nordic:
   * add read and write support for New Nordic format (see #2814)
   * fix bug where negative magnitudes were not read properly
   * fix bug where empty hours / minutes / seconds were not read as zero
   * fix bug where lat/lon-errors were read as lon/lat
   * fix bug where origin-error was written with RMS rather than time_error
   * for reading picks in Old Nordic format, set network code to None
     (was 'NA' previously)
   * stop writing waveform-file link to a DUMMY-file by default
   * add support for I/O of apparent velocity / horizontal slowness
   * add support for writing of multiple origins
   * add event-type mapping between Nordic and Obspy/Quakeml (do not fully
     match)
   * read pick-weight as pick.extra.nordic_pick_weight (was arrival.time_weight)
     and read finalweight into arrival.time_weight (or backazmiuth_weight)
     instead.
 - obspy.io.reftek:
   * enable reading data with floating point sampling rates like low sampling
     rate state-of-health channels (see #2678)
   * fix reading data in '16' and '32' encodings, when packets do not use
     the fixed maximum amount of available number of samples per data packet
     (see #2678)
   * properly take into account native system byteorder, should fix reading
     rt130 data on big endian systems (see #2678)
 - obspy.io.seiscomp:
   * Add support for SC3ML 0.11 and 0.12, dropped support for SC3ML < 0.6
     (see #2284).
   * Add support for custom tags (see #2284).
 - obspy.io.sh:
   * fix appending traces to existing Q file (see #2870)
 - obspy.io.xseed:
   * fix a bug reading SEED blockettes 48 and 58 which was likely never
     encountered (see #2668)
   * Properly read a given value of 0.0 in station elevation and not replace it
     with bogus value (see #2763)
 - obspy.signal.array_analysis
   * fixed an issue in array_processing function returning wrong times
     for matplotlib versions >= 3.3 due to the epoch change in matplotlib
     (see #2723)
 - obspy.signal.cross_correlation:
   * Remove deprecated xcorr function, remove deprecated domain keyword
     argument in correlate function (see #1979)

     noise models for plotting (see #2740)
   * Replaced use of deprecated Matplotlib functionality (see #2951)
 - obspy.signal.trigger:
   * Improved clarity and speed of several STA/LTA triggers methods, namely
     classic_sta_lta_py, z_detector, and recursive_sta_lta_py (see #2892)
   * Added simple AIC method by Maeda (1985)

 - obspy.core:
   * Fix wrong values in Stats object after deepcopy or pickle of Stats object
     for edge cases (see #2601)
 - obspy.clients.fdsn:
   * EIDA routing client: fix an issue that leaded to a request of *all* EIDA
     data when requesting an invalid, out-of-epochs time window for a valid
     station (see #2611)
   * update RASPISHAKE URL mapping to use https
   * fix a bug of not handling HTTPException in mass_downloader (see #2606)

Changes:
 - obspy.core:
   * Inventory objects have been adapted to StationXML 1.1 for details on
     changes see #2510 and
     https://github.com/FDSN/StationXML/blob/master/Changes.md
   * Fixed import of custom plugins (see #2423)
   * Fixed "==" comparison for Stream and Trace which was very slow in case of
     traces with >1e6 samples (see #2377)
   * Added almost_equal method for Stream and Trace classes (see #2286).
   * Casting FDSN identifiers to strings upon setting in the stats dictionary
     (see #1997).
   * UTCDateTime objects will now always evaluate equal if their string
     representations are equal (see #2049).
   * UTCDateTime objects now issue depreciation warnings when setting any
     attributes outside of init, or comparing UTCDateTime objects with
     different precisions (see #2077).
   * UTCDateTime objects can now accept hour, minute, second, and microsecond
     values greater than their normal limits by setting the strict keyword
     argument to False (see #2232).
   * Fixed UTCDateTime(..., julday=366) for non-leap years. This was returning
     January 1st of the next year in case of non-leap years being used. Now it
     properly raises an out-of-bounds ValueError (see #2369)
   * When reading StationXML/SC3ML, make sure to properly read empty string
     fields as empty strings instead of "None" (see #2519 and #2527)
   * Better ISO8601 detection for UTCDateTime objects and UTCDateTime(...,
     iso8601=False) now completely disables ISO8601 handling (see #2447)
   * Added replace method to UTCDateTime class (see #2077).
   * Added remove method to Inventory class (see #2088).
   * Added id property to WaveformStreamID (see #2131).
   * Added __str__ and _repr_pretty_ method for Comment class (see #2115)
   * Added __eq__ to QuantityError so empty instances equal None (see #2185).
   * Reworked the event scoped resource identifiers for the event classes
     hopefully fixing all edge-cases (see #2091).
   * Added a hook to allow users to customize finding objects for
     resource_ids which are not found via the normal means (see #2279).
   * Calling Stream.write(...) on an empty stream will now raise an
     ObsPyException consistently across all I/O plugins (see #2201)
   * Stream.get_gaps() will now properly report gaps within Traces that
     have masked arrays (i.e. Traces that have been merged without a fill
     value, see #2299 and #2300).
   * Added copy method to Inventory class (see #2322).
   * The Response.recalculate_overall_sensitivity() method now accepts integers
     (see #2338, #2343).
   * Added wildcard and url support to read_inventory (see #2326).
   * Modified stream.get_gaps() to deal with overlaps correctly (see #1403)
   * Added option "label_epoch_dates" to Inventory/Network.plot_response() to
     optionally add channel epoch start/end dates to legend labels (see #2309)
   * Deprecated the convert_id_to_quakeml_uri, regenerate_uuid, and
     get_quakeml_uri methods of the ResourceIdentifier class (see #2303).
   * Added get_quakeml_uri_str and get_quakeml_id methods to the
     ResourceIdentifier class (see #2303).
   * New method to create response objects directly from poles and zeros (see
     #1962).
   * Added Stream.stack method (see #2440).
   * Added a component field to the Stats object which allows to get and set
     the last character of the SEED channel (see #2484).
   * Fixed a bug in Stream.plot(type='section', reftime=..., ...) that caused
     wrong relative start times of traces relative to given reftime (see #2493)
   * Fixed a Windows-specific path case issue in a helper function that returns
     a list of untracked files in the git repository (see #2296)
   * Fix a bug that was causing an exception being raised in `Response.plot()`
     because a float was being passed down to numpy.linspace as length of array
     (see #2533)
   * Geographic select of inventory/network/station (see #2515)
   * Select traces in Stream based on an Inventory (see #2531)
 - obspy.clients.fdsn:
   * Add new `_discover_services` boolean flag to the Client, which allows the
     Client to skip the initial services query at instantiation.  This can
     reduce the load on service providers, but skips checks against unsupported
     query parameters.
   * Adding more location codes to the default priority list in the mass
     downloader (see #2155, #2159).
   * The mass downloader now raises a warning if all channels from a station
     have been deselected due to the default location priorities setting. This
     is a pure usability improvement as it has been confusing users
     (see #2159).
   * Make sure that streams fetched via FDSN are properly trimmed to user
     requested times if data center serves additional data around the start/end
     (see #1887, #2298)
   * Fix a problem that could spam subprocesses that were not closed in routed
     clients (see #2342 and #2344)

   * Add method "get_info()" to fetch information on what
     networks/stations/locations/channels are served by the seedlink server
     (see #2405)
   * "get_waveforms()" can now be used with '*' and '?' wildcards in any part
     of requested SEED ID, i.e. network, station, location and channel (see
     #2405)
 - obspy.clients.seishub:
   * Properly handle fetching poles and zeros in presence of multiple metadata
     files for a given station (see #2411)
 - obspy.geodetics:
   * New utility function `inside_geobounds()` to check whether an object is
     inside a geographic bound (see #2515)
 - obspy.imaging:
   * obspy-scan can now be used with wildcarded SEED IDs when specifying what
     to plot after scanning data (see #2227)
   * Fix a problem in Scanner when loading npz on Python3 that was written on
     Python2 (see #2413)
   * Fix an issue that could make small landmasses not get plotted in basemap
     plots (see #2471, #2477)
   * Fixed a bug in Stream.plot(type='section', reftime=..., ...) that caused
     wrong relative start times of traces relative to given reftime (see #2493)

 - obspy.io.mseed:
   * Fix a bug resulting in an infinite loop when trying to read a FullSEED
     file without any data records (see #2534 and #2535)
   * Add ability to write int64 data to mseed if it can safely be downcast
     to int32 data, otherwise raises ObsPyMSEEDError. (see #2356)
   * The recordanalyzer can now detect calibration blockettes 300, 310,
     and 320 (see #2370).
   * Can now write zero sampling-rate traces. (see #2488, 2509)
   * Updated to libmseed 2.19.6. (see #2966)

   * Output preferred origin when writing to Nordic format instead of using
     the first origin (see #2195)
   * Include high-accuracy phase-pick reading and writing - high-accuracy is
     now the default phase-writing format, a boolean flag `high_accuracy`
     has been added to turn this off. (see #2351 and #2348)
   * Allow long-phase names (both reading and writing) - longer than 4 char.
     (see #2351)
   * Include AIN as takeoff-angle when reading and writing nordic files
     (see #2404).
   * Add error ellipses and read high-accuracy hypocenter lines (see #2451)
   * Fix the incorrect handling of events missing pick evaluation information
     (see #2520)

     see #1439).
   * Instrument correction for response list stages originating from inventory
     objects (see #1514).

     the jupyter notebooks (see #1615).
 - obspy.imaging.cm:
   * new colormap: viridis_white. This is a modification of viridis that

     microseconds are present. (see #1511)
 - obspy.io.zmap:
   * Use first origin/magnitude when writing to zmap if no origin/magnitude is
     set as preferred. (see #1569)
   * Parse origin time seconds as a float to avoid losing accuracy (see #1573)
 - obspy.signal:
   * PPSD: fix warning message on Python 3 that gets shown when waveforms and
     metadata mismatch (see #1506)

1.0.2: (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.49636)
 - obspy.core:
   * Added workaround for numpy issue where many FFTs of various lengths fill
     a cache that never gets cleared, effectively creating a memory leak
     (see #1424).
   * Trace.filter and Stream.filter don't work on masked arrays anymore because
     it produced unpredictable results due to the un-initialized data-chunk.
     The uninitialized masked gap is now also initialized to np.nan in case
     of floating point data which and a consistent fill value in case of
     integer data. (see #1363)
 - obspy.clients.fdsn:
   * Fixing issue with location codes potentially resulting in unwanted data
     to be requested. (see #1422)
   * Included low-gain seismometers in default channel filters in
     mass-downloader, also included non-oriented channels by default
     (see #1373).
 - obspy.db:
   * Fixed a bug in obspy-indexer command line script (see #1369,
     command line script was not working, probably since 0.10.0)
 - obspy.imaging:
   * Fixed a bug that leads to pressure/tension color blending when plotting
     semi-transparent DC beachball patches (i.e. with "alpha" not equal to 1,
     see #1464)
   * Fixed a bug when plotting non-DC beachball patches without fill colors
     (i.e. with "nofill=True", see #1464)
   * Fix arbitrary units in waveform section plot's offset axis, making it
     possible to add customizations to the plot afterwards (see #1382, see
     #1383)
 - obspy.io.ascii:
   * Fixed a bug that lead to wrong header information in output files when
     writing non-integer sampling rate data to SLIST or TSPAIR formats
     (see #1447)
- obspy.io.cmtsolution:
   * Make sure newer CMTSOLUTION files can also be read (see #1479).
 - obspy.io.gse2:
   * Fixed a bug that could lead to network code not present in GSE2 output
     (see #1448)
 - obspy.io.mseed:
   * Fixed a bug in obspy-mseed-recordanalyzer (see #1386)
 - obspy.io.nlloc:
   * Use geographic coordinates from the NonLinLoc Hypocenter-Phase file if
     no custom coordinate converter is provided. (see #1390)
   * Fix reading NonLinLoc Hypocenter-Phase files with more than one
     hypocenter in it. (see #1480)
   * Fix reading NonLinLoc Hypocenter-Phase files with unicode characters in
     them. (see #1483)
 - obspy.io.quakeml:
   * Fixed issue with improperly raised warnings when the same file is read
     twice. (#1376)
   * Fix writing empty network/station/channel codes in WaveformStreamID
     objects to QuakeML. (see #1483)
 - obspy.io.sac:
   * Try to set SAC distances (dist, az, baz, gcarc) on read, if "lcalda" is
     true.  If "dist" header is found, distances aren't calculated.
   * SACTrace class returns header values as native Python types instead of
     NumPy types.
   * SACTrace.iqual is no longer accepts enumerated string values, but
     arbitrary integer values. (see #1472)
   * SACTrace.read now replaces non-ASCII and null-termination characters in
     string headers with whitespace unless the "debug_strings=True" flag is
     used. (see #1432)
 - obspy.io.stationxml:
   * Always set the number attribute for poles and zeros. (see #1481)
 - obspy.signal:
   * PPSD.plot(): fix plotting of percentiles, mode and mean and setting
     period limits when using "xaxis_frequency=True" (see #1406, #1416)
   * Work around a bug in SciPy that results in wrong results for bandpass
     filter when using Nyquist frequency (or higher) as high corner of the
     passband (see #1451)
 - obspy.taup:
   * Fixing path for Pn. (see #1392)

1.0.1: (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.48254)
 - General:
   * Some methods might have unnecessarily upcasted float32 arrays to float64.
     Now methods for which it makes sense and which don't lose accuracy don't
     upcast float32 arrays. Integers are still upcasted. Trace.resample() will
     also no longer return the original dtype which might have resulted in a
     large loss of accuracy but it now always returns float64 arrays.
     (see #1302)
 - obspy.core:
   * Trace.normalize() does no longer divide by zero in case an all-zeros
     data trace is being used. (see #1343)
   * Inventory.select() and consorts now behave as expected even with empty
     child elements. (see #1126, #1348)
   * Code formatting is no longer checked for clean release versions. Thus
     updates to the linters no longer break the tests for releases.
     (see #1312)
   * remove_response(..., pre_file=None, plot=True) works again. (see #1320)
 - obspy.clients.arclink:
   * Restored ArcLink encryption support. (see #1352, #1347)
 - obspy.clients.fdsn:
   * Local URLs are now recognized as valid URLs. (see #1309)
   * Some bug fixes for the mass downloader. (see #1293, #1304)
   * The NOA node has been added to the list of known nodes.
     (see 2347a25714bc3e16068031f4b6138fafd627d34e)
 - obspy.io.sac:
   * More automatic merging of SAC and ObsPy headers. The new `obspy.io.sac`
     modules thus behaves more like the old one and more in line with
     expectations of users. (see #1285)
   * No more out of bounds errors when assigning coordinates. (see #1300)
   * The evdp header can be set again. (see #1345)
   * Correctly propagating sampling rate changes to the SAC headers.
     (see #1317)
   * Always set nvhdr, leven, lovrok, iftype to ensure valid SAC files.
     (see #1204)
 - obspy.io.xseed:
   * The Parser.get_paz() method now works with multiple blockette 53s.
     (see #1281)
 - obspy.taup
   * Fixed wrong azimuth direction for paths > 180 degrees distance (see #1289)
   * Azimuth is appended to arrivals as well (see #1289)
   * Fixed issue with taup cache function on Python 2.7. (see #1308)

1.0.0: (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.46151)
 - General:
   * Requirements have been increased to reflect latest distributions:
     * Removed support for Python 2.6.
     * Added support for Python 3.5.
     * matplotlib >= 1.1.0 is now required.
     * numpy >= 1.6.1 is now required
     * scipy >= 0.9.0 is now required
   * Reorganized the submodule structure. We provide a deprecation path so the
     old imports will continue to work for one ObsPy version.
   * Consistent naming scheme across the code base. This results in some
     functions having different names. Most things that worked with ObsPy 0.10
     will continue to work with this version, but starting with the next
     version they will fail. Pay attention to the deprecation warnings.
   * Support for additional waveform data formats:
     - Read support for the ASCII format for waveforms from the K-NET and
       KiK-net strong-motion seismograph networks.
   * Support for additional event data formats:
     - CMTSOLUTION files used by many waveform solvers.
     - ESRI shapefile write support, useful in GIS applications (see #1066)
     - Google Earth KML output.
   * Support for additional station data format:
     - The FDSN web service station text format can now be read.
     - Read support for the NIED's moment tensor TEXT format (see #1125)
     - Google Earth KML output.
     - Read support for SeisComP3 inventory files.
 - obspy.core:
   * New method for generating sliding windows from Stream/Trace windows.
     (see #860)
   * Stream/Trace.slice() now has the optional `nearest_sample` argument from
     Stream/Trace.trim().
   * Trace.remove_response() now has `plot` option to show/output a plot of all
     individual steps of instrument response removal in frequency domain
     (see #1116).
   * New method Stream/Trace.remove_sensitivity() to remove instrument
     sensitivity
   * Fix incorrect parsing of some non-ISO8601 date/time strings. (see #1215)
   * Added plotting method to Event (customizable subplots from a selection
     of map, beachball and farfield radiation plots, see #1192)
 - obspy.clients.fdsn:
   * Replace FDSN webservice shortcut `NERIES` with `EMSC` and deprecate the
     `NERIES` shortcut, will be removed in a future release (see #1146).
   * Now requests gzipped data for the XML files. Much smaller files!
   * The station service can now also be used to download files in the text
     format. This has limited information but is much faster.
   * New mass downloader to assist in downloading data across a large number
     of FDSN web services.
   * Catch invalid URLs when initialising Client and avoid confusing error
     messages (see #1162)
 - obspy.clients.filesystem.sds:
   * New client to read data from local SDS directory structure (see #1135).
   * Command line script `obspy-sds-report` to generate html page with
     information on latency, data availability percentage and number of gaps
     for a local SDS archive (see #1202)
 - obspy.clients.neries:
   * Removed the dedicated client. Data can still be accessed by using the FDSN
     client.
 - obspy.clients.syngine:
   * New client for the IRIS Syngine service to retrieve custom synthetic
     seismograms.
 - obspy.imaging:
   * Experimental support for Cartopy when plotting maps. Use the `method`
     argument to functions that plot maps to select between Basemap or Cartopy.
   * New default colormap for all plots. A backport of the new viridis colormap
     from matplotlib is available for those using older matplotlib releases.
   * Added plotting routines for farfield radiation patterns of moment tensors
 - obspy.io.kml:
   * New module for Google KML output of Inventory and Catalog objects
     (e.g. for use in Google Earth)
 - obspy.io.mseed:
   * Upgrade to libmseed 2.16
 - obspy.io.seiscomp.sc3ml:
   * New module reading SeisComP3 inventory files to ObsPy inventory objects
     (see #1182).
 - obspy.io.shapefile:
   * New module for ESRI shapefile write support (see #1066)
 - obspy.io.stationtxt:
   * New module reading the FDSN station files.
 - obspy.signal:
   * Switch to second-order sections for filters; backported from SciPy 0.16.0
     (see #1028)
   * New Lanczos interpolation/resampling (see #1101)
   * Higher order detrending methods (see #1173)
   * PPSD (see #931, #1108, #1130, #1187):
     - Algorithm for PSD computation was improved, especially affecting results
       at long periods (for detailed discussion see #931 and #1108).
     - Keywords `paz` and `parser` were removed in favor of new keyword
       `metadata`. PPSD now accepts `metadata` in a much wider range
       of formats:
          * Inventory objects (e.g. from StationXML or from FDSN webservice)
          * obspy.io.xseed Parser objects (e.g. from dataless SEED file)
          * filename of a RESP file
          * dictionary with poles and zeros information (like in
            prior versions)
       Most old codes should still work, issuing a deprecation warning, but
       old code that specifies *both* `paz` and `parser` keywords will raise
       an exception.
     - Whenever possible (i.e. when using for `metadata` an Inventory,
       a Parser or a RESP file), response calculation now takes into account
       the full response (all stages) as opposed to only using the poles and
       zeros response stage (as was done in previous versions when using a
       Parser object). When using a poles and zeros dictionary response
       calculation is unchanged (as no information on other stages is
       available, of course).
     - PPSD now stores the psd for each time segment that gets processed,
       instead of only storing the stacked histogram. That way, differing
       custom stacks with various selection criteria (e.g. time of day, by
       weekday, etc.) can now be made from the same processed data
       (see #1130).
     - New save/load mechanism using numpy .npz binary format that circumvents
       some problems with the old pickle mechanism:
       `PPSD.save_npz()` and `PPSD.load_npz()` (and `PPSD.add_npz()` to add
       data from additional npz files)
     - Change default colormap to new obspy default sequential colormap
       (matplotlibs new viridis colormap). The old PQLX colormap is provided by
       `obspy.imaging.cm.pqlx` and can be used with
       `PPSD.plot(..., cmap=...)`.
     - new option `PPSD.plot(..., cumulative=True)` for a cumulative plot of
       the histogram, i.e. a non-exceedence percentage visualization, similar
       to the `percentile` option.
     - x axis in `PPSD.plot()` can be switched to frequency in Hz with
       `PPSD.plot(..., xaxis_frequency=True)` (see #1130)
     - changes to special handling of rotational: now handled by kwarg
       `special_handling="ringlaser"` (kwarg `is_rotational_data` is
       deprecated, see #916)
     - special handling option for hydrophone data (no differentiation, see
       #916)
     - bin width on frequency axis can now be controlled using
       `PPSD(..., frequency_bin_width_octaves=...)` (in fractions of octaves,
       default is the old fixed setting of 1/8 octaves as in PQLX)
 - obspy.taup
   * Added support for nd file format for input velocity models. Allows for
     named discontinuities at arbitrary depths allowing for less Earth like
     models (see #1147).
   * Added three methods (`get_travel_times_geo()`, `get_pierce_points_geo()`
     and `get_ray_paths_geo()`) to `TauPyModel` to handle station and
     event location data as latitude and longitude, instead of the source to
     station distance in degrees. In addition `get_ray_paths_geo()` and
     `get_pierce_points_geo()` decorate the returned pierce points and ray
     paths with the latitude and longitude of each point. Some functionality
     needs the `geographiclib` module to be installed. (See #1164.)
   * ObsPy now ships with a bunch of new velocity models in addition to the
     existing ones: `prem`, `sp6`, `1066a,b`, `herrin` (See #1196).
   * Add support for buried receivers (see #1103.)
   * Port more accurate calculation of ray parameter from Java. The effect is
     stronger for longer phases, but also corrects issues with shorter body and
     surface waves (see #986.)
   * Fix incorrect branch splitting which also caused issues for extremely
     shallow phases (see #1057.)
   * Proper cache for model splits resulting in much faster calculations if
     the source depth is repeatedly the same (see #1248).

0.10.3: (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.46150)
  - obspy.core:
    * Fix reading of multiple catalog files using globs (see #1065).
    * Fixed a bug when using
      `Trace.remove_response(..., water_level=None)`.
      With that setting that is supposed to not use any water level
      stabilization in the inversion of the instrument response
      spectrum actually the instrument response was never inverted and
      thus instead of a deconvolution a convolution was performed
      (see #1104).
    * Fixing floating point precision/rounding issue with UTCDateTime when
      initializing with floating point seconds, i.e. with microseconds,
      that could lead to microseconds being off by 1 microsecond
      (see #1096)
    * Correct gap/overlap time returned by Stream.get_gaps() and printed
      by Stream.print_gaps() which was incorrect by one time the sampling
      interval (see #1151)
    * Stream.get_gaps(): return overlaps specified in units of samples
      as negative integers (see #1151)
  - obspy.fdsn:
    * More detailed error messages on failing requests (see #1079)
    * Follows redirects for POST requests (see #1143)
  - obspy.imaging:
    * fix some bugs in `obspy-scan` (see #1138)
  - obspy.mseed:
    * Blockette 100 is now only written for Traces that need it. Previously
      it was written or not for all Traces, depending on whether the last
      Trace needed it or not. (see #1069)
    * Fixed a bug that prevented microsecond accuracy for times before 1970
      (see #1102).
    * Updated to libmseed 2.17.
  - obspy.signal:
    * Bug fixed within rotate.rotate2zne(). Additionally it can now also
      perform the inverse rotation (see #1061).
    * Bug fixed in triggering. When using option `max_len_delete` and a trigger
      occurred right before the end of data, one trigger was potentially lost
      (see #1145 for details).
  - obspy.station:
    * Plotting responses across multiple channels is more robust now in
      presence of some strange channels (e.g. with zero sampling rate,
      happens e.g. for state of health channels, see #1115)
    * ObsPy no longer assumes that the StationXML namespace is the default
      namespace (see #1060).
    * Checking if a file is a StationXML file is less rigorous (and much
      faster) now (not checking strict validity against xsd schema but
      only looking for a FDSNStationXML root element, see #1114).
      This means that `read_inventory()` without explicitly specified
      format will correctly detect more files as StationXML that have very
      slight breaches of the schema but still can be interpreted as
      StationXML.
    * fix saving `xcorrPickCorrection()` results to an image file (see #1154)
  - obspy.taup:
    * Calculating arrival times for surface waves now works (see #1055)
    * Calculating arrivals for underside reflections now works (see #1089)
  - obspy.y:
    * correct misspelled name of a Y specific header field (see #1127)
  - obspy.zmap
    * Add support for time values with sub-second precision (see #1093)

 - obspy.core:
   * Fix catalog plot with events that have no origin depth or
     origin time (see #1021)

 - obspy.earthworm:
   * Fix Python3 compatibility problem
 - obspy.imaging:
   * Fix flipped maps due to bug in Basemap
   * Fix handling of velocity reduction in section plots with degree offsets
     (see #1029)
   * Allow section plots over existing figures by not modifying existing lines
   * Don't prematurely close waveform figure if returning its handle
 - obspy.seedlink:
   * Fix Python3 compatibility for seedlink.easyseedlink
   * Basic seedlink client: Properly timeout requests with valid station
     selection but no data available in selected time window (see #1045)
 - obspy.signal:
   * Fix return data types/values of polarization routines (see #1026)
 - obspy.station:
   * Fix URL to FDSN StationXML schema in StationXML output (see #1023)

     equal-area projections:
     * The `"cyl"` projection is now named `"global"`. It is now the Mollweide
       projection.
     * The '"local"` projection now uses the Albers Equal Area projection.

 - obspy.mseed:
   * Support for reading and writing all encodings supported by libmseed.
   * proper error reporting while reading
   * `details=True` when reading will now write to
     `Trace.stats.mseed.blkt1001.timing_quality` instead of
     `Trace.stats.mseed.timing_quality`.
   * The timing quality will now also be written to a file if it is set.
   * Non-existing values when reading with `details=True` will now be set to
     `False` instead of `-1`.
   * New utility function `obspy.mseed.util.set_flags_in_fixed_header()`
     giving the ability to overwrite flags in the fixed header of existing
     MiniSEED files.
   * The sequence number of the first record of each Trace can now be
     specified when writing MiniSEED files.
   * `obspy-mseed-recordanalyzer`:
       - Bugfix: when specifying an out-of-bounds record number, information
         about the last record in the file was displayed (see #957). Now a
         proper error message is shown and the command line script exits
         with non-zero exit code.
       - Faster reading of a single record header
       - Added option "-a" to print information of all records
   * upgrade to libmseed 2.15
 - obspy.ndk:
   * New submodule able to read NDK files from the Global CMT project.
 - obspy.neries:
