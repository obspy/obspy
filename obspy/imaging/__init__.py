obspy.imaging - Plotting Routines for ObsPy
===========================================
This module provides routines for plotting and displaying often used in
seismology. It can currently plot waveform data, generate spectrograms and draw
beachballs. The module :mod:`obspy.imaging` depends on the plotting module
`matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_.

Seismograms
-----------
This submodule can plot multiple :class:`~obspy.core.trace.Trace` in one
:class:`~obspy.core.stream.Stream` object and has various other optional
arguments to adjust the plot, such as color and tick format changes.

Additionally the start- and endtime of the plot can be given as
:class:`~obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime` objects.

Examples files may be retrieved via http://examples.obspy.org.

>>> from obspy import read
>>> st = read()
>>> print(st)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
3 Trace(s) in Stream:
BW.RJOB..EHZ | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
BW.RJOB..EHN | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
BW.RJOB..EHE | 2009-08-24T00:20:03.000000Z - ... | 100.0 Hz, 3000 samples
>>> st.plot(color='gray', tick_format='%I:%M %p',
...         starttime=st[0].stats.starttime,
...         endtime=st[0].stats.starttime+20)

.. plot::

    from obspy import read
    st = read()
    st.plot(color='gray', tick_format='%I:%M %p',
            starttime=st[0].stats.starttime,
            endtime=st[0].stats.starttime+20)

Spectrograms
------------
The :mod:`obspy.imaging.spectrogram` submodule plots spectrograms.

The spectrogram will on default have 90% overlap and a maximum sliding window
size of 4096 points. For more info see
:func:`obspy.imaging.spectrogram.spectrogram`.

>>> from obspy import read
>>> st = read()
>>> st[0].spectrogram(log=True) #doctest: +SKIP

.. plot::

    from obspy import read
    st = read()
    st[0].spectrogram(log=True)

Beachballs
----------
Draws a beach ball diagram of an earthquake focal mechanism.

.. note::
    ObsPy ships with two engines for beachball generation.

    (1) :mod:`obspy.imaging.beachball`
        is based on the program from the
        `Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)`_ and the MATLAB script `bb.m`_ written by
        Andy Michael and Oliver Boyd, which both have known limitations.
    (2) :mod:`obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper`
        is based on the the *Moment tensor Plotting and Decomposition tool*
        (MoPaD) [Krieger2012]_. MoPaD is more correct, however it consumes much
        more processing time.

    The function calls for creating beachballs are similar in both modules. The
    following examples are based on the first module, however those example
    will also work with MoPaD by using

    >>> from obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper import Beachball

    and

    >>> from obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper import Beach

    respectively.

.. _`Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)`: http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu
.. _`bb.m`: http://www.ceri.memphis.edu/people/olboyd/Software/Software.html


.. rubric:: Examples

(1) The focal mechanism can be given by 3 (strike, dip, and rake) components.
    The strike is of the first plane, clockwise relative to north. The dip is
    of the first plane, defined clockwise and perpendicular to strike, relative
    to horizontal such that 0 is horizontal and 90 is vertical. The rake is of
    the first focal plane solution. 90 moves the hanging wall up-dip (thrust),
    0 moves it in the strike direction (left-lateral), -90 moves it down-dip
    (normal), and 180 moves it opposite to strike (right-lateral).

    >>> from obspy.imaging.beachball import Beachball
    >>> np1 = [150, 87, 1]
    >>> Beachball(np1) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <matplotlib.figure.Figure object at 0x...>

    .. plot::

        from obspy.imaging.beachball import Beachball
        np1 = [150, 87, 1]
        Beachball(np1)

(2) The focal mechanism can also be specified using the 6 independent
    components of the moment tensor (M11, M22, M33, M12, M13, M23). For
    :func:`obspy.imaging.beachball.Beachball` (1, 2, 3) corresponds to
    (Up, South, East) which is equvalent to (r, theta, phi). For
    :func:`obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper.Beachball` the coordinate system can be
    chosen and includes the choices 'NED' (North, East, Down), 'USE' (Up,
    South, East), 'NWU' (North, West, Up) or 'XYZ'.

    >>> from obspy.imaging.beachball import Beachball
    >>> mt = [-2.39, 1.04, 1.35, 0.57, -2.94, -0.94]
    >>> Beachball(mt) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    <matplotlib.figure.Figure object at 0x...>

    .. plot::

        from obspy.imaging.beachball import Beachball
        mt = [-2.39, 1.04, 1.35, 0.57, -2.94, -0.94]
        Beachball(mt)

    For more info see :func:`obspy.imaging.beachball.Beachball` and
    :func:`obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper.Beachball`.

(3) Plot the beach ball as matplotlib collection into an existing plot.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from obspy.imaging.beachball import Beach
    >>>
    >>> np1 = [150, 87, 1]
    >>> mt = [-2.39, 1.04, 1.35, 0.57, -2.94, -0.94]
    >>> beach1 = Beach(np1, xy=(-70, 80), width=30)
    >>> beach2 = Beach(mt, xy=(50, 50), width=50)
    >>>
    >>> plt.plot([-100, 100], [0, 100], "rv", ms=20) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x...>]
    >>> ax = plt.gca()
    >>> ax.add_collection(beach1) #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.add_collection(beach2) #doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax.set_aspect("equal")
    >>> ax.set_xlim((-120, 120))
    (-120, 120)
    >>> ax.set_ylim((-20, 120))
    (-20, 120)

    .. plot::

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        from obspy.imaging.beachball import Beach
        np1 = [150, 87, 1]
        mt = [-2.39, 1.04, 1.35, 0.57, -2.94, -0.94]
        beach1 = Beach(np1, xy=(-70, 80), width=30)
        beach2 = Beach(mt, xy=(50, 50), width=50)
        plt.plot([-100, 100], [0, 100], "rv", ms=20)
        ax = plt.gca()
        ax.add_collection(beach1)
        ax.add_collection(beach2)
        ax.set_aspect("equal")
        ax.set_xlim((-120, 120))
        ax.set_ylim((-20, 120))

    :func:`obspy.imaging.mopad_wrapper.Beach`.


Saving plots into files
-----------------------
All plotting routines offer an ``outfile`` argument to save the result into a
file.

The ``outfile`` parameter is also used to automatically determine the file
format. Available output formats mainly depend on your matplotlib settings.
Common formats are png, svg, pdf or ps.

>>> from obspy import read
>>> st = read()
>>> st.plot(outfile='graph.png') #doctest: +SKIP
