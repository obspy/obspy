    Client for fetching waveform data from multiple sources

    ``MultiClient`` can be used to fetch waveform data in automated workflows
    requesting data from different clients from various submodules (or user
    defined clients) based on the SEED ID of the requested waveforms and a
    configuration that the user has to set up once beforehand. The
    ``MultiClient`` works based on a configuration file and provides a
    :meth:`~MultiClient.get_waveforms()` method that can be used to make
    waveform requests with the usual call syntax (network, station, location,
    channel, starttime, endtime).  In the configuration the user can define
    which SEED ID should be fetched using what client. This can happend in the
    simplemost case just based on the network code but also more fine grained
    based on network and station code.
    The MultiClient can be extended by arbitrary user defined clients by adding
    to ``supported_client_types`` and ``supported_client_kwargs`` as long as
    the provided client has a ``get_waveforms()`` method with the same call
    logic as obspy clients.

    :param config: Path to a local file with the textual config
    :type config: :class:`~pathlib.Path` or str
    :param debug: Can be set to ``True`` to pass down the debug flag to all
        used clients. This might lead to a lot of printed debug output. The
        debug flag can also be set just for certain individual clients through
        the configuration like any other client parameter.

    .. rubric:: Usage Example

    The configuration needs to be set up in a local file in ``ini`` style
    syntax used by :class:`~configparser.ConfigParser`. First of all, it has
    to contain a section ``[lookup]`` that determines which client type will be
    used and what server node to connect to depending on the SEED ID of the
    waveforms the user requests from the ``MultiClient``. Each option consists
    of the key which can be a network code or a network code and a station code
    (separated by a dot, like in usual SEED conventions) and a value string
    identifying a client definition. When waveforms are requested the lookup
    will be resolved in the following order (for this example the user waveform
    request is for ``GR.FUR..HH?``):

        - exact match of network and station code, i.e. check for an option
          ``GR.FUR``
        - wildcarded match of network and station code, i.e. would match e.g.
          an option ``GR.F*``
        - exact match of just the network code, i.e. would match an option
          ``GR``
