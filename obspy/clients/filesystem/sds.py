obspy.clients.filesystem.sds - read support for SeisComP Data Structure
=======================================================================
This module provides read support for data stored locally in a SeisComP Data
Structure (SDS) directory structure.

The directory and file layout of SDS is defined as::

    <SDSdir>/YEAR/NET/STA/CHAN.TYPE/NET.STA.LOC.CHAN.TYPE.YEAR.DAY

These fields are defined by SDS as follows::

    SDSdir :  arbitrary base directory
    YEAR   :  4 digit year
    NET    :  Network code/identifier, up to 8 characters, no spaces
    STA    :  Station code/identifier, up to 8 characters, no spaces
    CHAN   :  Channel code/identifier, up to 8 characters, no spaces
    TYPE   :  1 characters indicating the data type, recommended types are:
               'D' - Waveform data
               'E' - Detection data
               'L' - Log data
               'T' - Timing data
               'C' - Calibration data
               'R' - Response data
               'O' - Opaque data
    LOC    :  Location identifier, up to 8 characters, no spaces
    DAY    :  3 digit day of year, padded with zeros
