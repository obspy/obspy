"""
This module contains the Routing client and manager for ObsPy.  These classes
are intended to be subclassed.

:class:`~obspy.clients.fdsn.routers.RoutingClient`
This class contains the genericized methods used to query for information.
In general, it will first query the routing service, and depending upon
the response, query the specific services from each data provider.

:class:`~obspy.clients.fdsn.routers.RoutingManager`
This class will wrap the response given by routers in order to provide
an iterabler interface to the response parcels. Each parcel is a subclass of
:class:`~obspy.clients.fdsn.routers.RoutingResponse` and is usable to request
data from the provider.

:Note: Although it was originally intended that RoutingClient inherited from
:class:`~obspy.clients.fdsn.Client`, the Fedcatalog service is technically not
a federated service (yet).  It is running on a different path (../irisws/..),
and fails the many assumptions built into the Client class.

    This class serves as the user-facing layer for routing requests, and uses
    the Client's methods to communicate with each data center.  Where possible,
    it will also leverage the Client's methods to interact with the federated
    catalog service. The federated catalog's response is passed to the
    RoutingManager.

    The RoutingManager is then repeatedly queried for provider/url/bulk-request
    parcels, which are each routed to the appropriate provider using either
    Client.get_stations_bulk or Client.get_waveforms_bulk.  As each parcel of
    data is requested, the provider is displayed to console. As each request is
    fulfilled, then a summary of retrieved data is displayed.

    Upon completion, all the waveforms or inventory (station) data are returned
    in a single list /structure as though they were all requested from the same
    source.
