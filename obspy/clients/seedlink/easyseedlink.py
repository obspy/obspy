"""
A simplified interface to the obspy.clients.seedlink module.

The :class:`~.EasySeedLinkClient` class contained in this module provides a
more pythonic interface to the :mod:`obspy.clients.seedlink` module with a
focus on ease of use, while minimizing unnecessary exposure of the protocol
specifics.

A client object can easily be created using the :func:`~.create_client`
function, e.g. by providing a function to handle incoming data and a server
URL:

.. code-block:: python

    from obspy.clients.seedlink.easyseedlink import create_client

    # A function to handle incoming data
    def handle_data(trace):
        print('Received the following trace:')
        print(trace)
        print()

    # Create the client and pass the function as a callback
    client = create_client('geofon.gfz-potsdam.de', on_data=handle_data)
    client.select_stream('BW', 'MANZ', 'EHZ')
    client.run()

For advanced applications, subclassing the :class:`~.EasySeedLinkClient` class
allows for more flexibility. See the :class:`~.EasySeedLinkClient`
documentation for an example.

.. note::

    For finer grained control of the SeedLink connection (e.g. custom
    processing of individual SeedLink packets), using
    :class:`~obspy.clients.seedlink.client.seedlinkconnection.SeedLinkConnection`
    or :class:`~obspy.clients.seedlink.slclient.SLClient` directly might be the
    preferred option.

.. rubric:: Limitations

As of now, single station mode is not supported. Neither are in-stream ``INFO``
requests.

The client is using the
:class:`~obspy.clients.seedlink.client.seedlinkconnection.SeedLinkConnection`
class and hence inherits all of its limitations. For example, erroneous packets
are only logged, but otherwise ignored, with no possibility of handling them
explicitly. Keepalive handling is completely encapsulated inside the
connection object and cannot be easily influenced. Also, a ``HELLO`` is always
sent to the server when connecting in order to determine the SeedLink protocol
version.

        connection was started explicitly, either when ``autoconnect`` is
        ``True`` or by calling :meth:`~.EasySeedLinkClient.connect` explicitly.
        Otherwise the client might get stuck in an infinite reconnect loop if
        there are connection problems (e.g. connect, timeout, reconnect,
        timeout, ...). This might be intended behavior in some situations.
