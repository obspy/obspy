Overview
--------

DYNA/ITACA format read and write support for ObsPy.

This module provides read and write support for the ASCII-based DYNA format
and the legacy ITACA format (read-only suport). These formats were defined by
the ITACA team at INGV Milano and are mainly used for strong-motion data.
 
DYNA 1.0 format specifications are available at the following URL:

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
