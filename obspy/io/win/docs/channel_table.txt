<<< Data Format >>>
We adopt the WIN32 format for the seismic waveform data. The definition of WIN32 format is explained in detail at 
http://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp/REGS/manual/win32.pdf (presently the manual is available only in Japanese).

To convert WIN32 waveform data to SAC data, you can use "win2sac_32" routine, which is included in the "win32tools" software package. 
For more details, please see the following webpage:
http://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp/REGS/manual/win32tool/ (in Japanese).


<<< Channels Table >>>
To extract particular waveforms (e.g. the vertical component seismogram recorded at station N.IWTH) from WIN32 data, you need a file that contains basic information  about seismic stations and sensors (e.g., station name, motion component, station location, sensitivity). Such a file (i.e. the "channels table") is included together with the WIN32 data file in the compressed file that you have downloaded from our web page.
We sometimes replace the sensor(s) to fix some troubles, so we attach a daily file (or files) that corresponds (correspond) to the date you need. You should use the suitable file.

The following is an example of channel information within the channels table. All columns are divided by "space".
