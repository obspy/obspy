Unix: the Makefile should work for most systems, try 'make'.

Win32: the Makefile.win is for Microsoft's nmake (e.g. 'nmake -f
Makefile.win') and Makefile.wat is for Open Watcom's wmake
(e.g. 'wmake -f Makefile.wat').


msview.c:

An example program that demonstrates basic usage of libmseed.  A
Makefile is provided to build the program.  The example does not
exercise all of the functionality of libmseed but should illustrate
some of the basic ideas.

msrepack.c:

An example of using libmseed to build Mini-SEED records, this 
program will repack input Mini-SEED data.
