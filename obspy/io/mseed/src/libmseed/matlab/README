The contents of this directory are wrapper MEX functions that interface
libmseed functionality with Matlab and GNU Octave.

A help message is included for each function interface wrapper, simply
typing the name of the function from within Matlab/Octave will display
a simple usage message.

-- Building --

The static libmseed.a library must already be built before compiling the
mex interface routines.

On most Unix like systems you'll first need to edit Makefile and set the
MEX variable to your desired 'mex'/'mkoctfile'.  Then a simple 'make'
should compile the mex interface routines.
