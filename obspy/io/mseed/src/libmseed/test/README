== The libmseed test suite ==

General mechanics:

Each *.c file is compiled into an executable, linking options for libmseed
are included.  The test passes if an executable is produced.

Each *.test file must be an executable (e.g. shell script) and have a
companion *.test.ref reference file.  The *.test file is executed, the
output saved to *.test.out and compared to the reference.  If the files
match the test passes.

The executables are built first as they are used in the later tests.
