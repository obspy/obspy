.TH MSR_SAMPRATE 3 2006/02/27 "Libmseed API"
.SH NAME
msr_samprate - Determine sample rate from an MSRecord structure

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libmseed.h>

.BI "double  \fBmsr_samprate\fP ( MSRecord *" msr " );

.BI "double  \fBmsr_nomsamprate\fP ( MSRecord *" msr " );
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmsr_samprate\fP will calculate a double precision sample rate in
samples per second using the header values in the specified MSRecord.
If a Blockette 100 is included, the "Actual sample rate" (field 3)
will be returned, otherwise a nominal sample rate will be calculated
from the sample rate factor and multiplier in the fixed section data
header.

NOTE: The sample rate for a MSRecord structure is available directly
at MSRecord.samplerate.  libmseed based programs should use that
sample rate whenever possible (\fBmsr_unpack\fP uses
\fBmsr_samprate\fP to set MSRecord.samplerate).

\fBmsr_nomsamprate\fP will calculate a double precision sample rate in
samples per second using the sample rate factor and multiplier in the
fixed section data header.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBmsr_samprate\fP returns a double precision sample rate on success
and -1.0 on error.

\fBmsr_nomsamprate\fP returns a double precision sample rate on
success and -1.0 on error.

.SH SEE ALSO
\fBms_intro(3)\fP and \fBmsr_unpack(3)\fP.
