Overview

CMTSOLUTION event file format support for ObsPy

The obspy.io.cmtsolution module provides read/write support for the
CMTSOLUTION file format used by many wave propagation solvers.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
