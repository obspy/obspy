Dear Sir

Thank you for your inquiry.

We send a part of DATAMARK LS-7000XT user's manual as a format 
description document.
Attached file name: E-MAN_LS-7000XT_7_format.pdf

Some of our products uses two kind of data format, type A0 and A1.
Type A0 is also called "win format", and A1 is extended version of it.
We recommend you to support type A0, because type A0 conforms to the 
data format of the WIN system developed by Earthquake Research Institute 
(ERI), the University of Tokyo, but type A1 is not recently used in most 
our product.

Please see the web page of ERI.
