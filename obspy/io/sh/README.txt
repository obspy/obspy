Overview
--------
Q and ASC (Seismic Handler) read and write support for ObsPy.

The obspy.io.sh package contains methods in order to read and write seismogram
files in the Q and ASC format used by the Seismic Handler software package
(http://www.seismic-handler.org).

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
