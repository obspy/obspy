Overview
--------
Dataless SEED, RESP and XML-SEED read and write support for ObsPy.

The obspy.io.xseed package contains methods in order to read, write and convert
seismological meta data files in the Dataless SEED, RESP and XML-SEED format.

ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python framework for
processing seismological data. It provides parsers for common file formats and
seismological signal processing routines which allow the manipulation of
seismological time series (see Beyreuther et al. 2010, Megies et al. 2011).
The goal of the ObsPy project is to facilitate rapid application development
for seismology.
