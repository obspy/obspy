    Blockette 012: Volume Time Span Index Blockette.

    This blockette forms an index to the time spans that encompass the actual
    data. One index entry exists for each time span recorded later in the
    volume. Time spans are not used for field station type volumes. There
    should be one entry in this index for each time span control header.
    (For more information, see the notes for blockettes [70], [73], and [74].)
