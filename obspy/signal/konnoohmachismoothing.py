    Calculate the Konno & Ohmachi smoothing window(s).

    Returns the smoothing window around the center frequency with one value per
    input frequency defined as follows (see [Konno1998]_)::

            b   = bandwidth
            f   = frequency
            f_c = center frequency

    If an array is provided for center_frequency then a 2D array is returned
    where each row is a smoothing window for the corresponding center
    frequency.

    The bandwidth of the smoothing function is constant on a logarithmic scale.
    A small value will lead to a strong smoothing, while a large value of will
    lead to a low smoothing of the Fourier spectra.
    The default (and generally used) value for the bandwidth is 40. (From the
    `Geopsy documentation <http://www.geopsy.org>`_)

    All parameters need to be positive. This is not checked due to performance
    reasons and therefore any negative parameters might have unexpected
    results.

    :param center_frequency:

    :type bandwidth: float
    :param bandwidth:
        Determines the width of the smoothing peak. Lower values result in a
