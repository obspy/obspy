obspy.neries - NERIES Web service client for ObsPy
==================================================
The obspy.neries package contains a client for the Seismic Data Portal
(http://www.seismicportal.eu) which was developed under the European
Commission-funded NERIES project. The Portal provides a single point of access
to diverse, distributed European earthquake data provided in a unique joint
initiative by observatories and research institutes in and around Europe.

Basic Usage
-----------
(1) :meth:`~obspy.neries.client.Client.getEvents()`:
    This service was shut down on the server side, please use the
    obspy.fdsn Client instead (with `base_url='NERIES'`).

(2) :meth:`~obspy.neries.client.Client.getLatestEvents()`:
    This service was shut down on the server side, please use the
    obspy.fdsn Client instead (with `base_url='NERIES'`).

(3) :meth:`~obspy.neries.client.Client.getEventDetail()`:
    This service was shut down on the server side, please use the
    obspy.fdsn Client instead (with `base_url='NERIES'`).

(4) :meth:`~obspy.neries.client.Client.getWaveform()`: Wraps a NERIES Web
    service build on top of the ArcLink protocol. Here we give a small example
    how to fetch and display waveforms.

    >>> from obspy.neries import Client
    >>> from obspy import UTCDateTime
    >>> client = Client(user='test@obspy.org')
    >>> dt = UTCDateTime("2009-08-20 04:03:12")
    >>> st = client.getWaveform("BW", "RJOB", "", "EH*", dt - 3, dt + 15)
    >>> st.plot()  #doctest: +SKIP

    .. plot::

        from obspy.neries import Client
        from obspy import UTCDateTime
        client = Client(user='test@obspy.org')
        dt = UTCDateTime("2009-08-20 04:03:12")
        st = client.getWaveform("BW", "RJOB", "", "EH*", dt - 3, dt + 15)
        st.plot()

(5) :meth:`~obspy.neries.client.Client.getTravelTimes()`: Wraps a Taup Web
    service, an utility to compute arrival times using a few default velocity
    models such as ``'iasp91'``, ``'ak135'`` or ``'qdt'``.

    >>> from obspy.neries import Client
    >>> client = Client(user='test@obspy.org')
    >>> locations = [(48.0, 12.0), (48.1, 12.0)]
    >>> result = client.getTravelTimes(latitude=20.0, longitude=20.0,
    ...                                depth=10.0, locations=locations,
    ...                                model='iasp91')
    >>> len(result)
    2
    >>> result[0] # doctest: +SKIP
    {'P': 356981.13561726053, 'S': 646841.5619481194}
